        <p><b>What is this game about?</b> This is a top-down perspective stealth game. You need to get in and get out hopefully without being seen.
            Your main goal is to acquire the coveted giant ruby in each level. You do this by evading guards and
            security cameras while using all of the tools at your disposal.</p>

<div class="grayContainer">
    <div class="articleSection">
        <h class="sectionHeader">SNEAK AROUND!</h>
        <p><b>Guards patrol around the level!</b> Guards have a set patrol route in which they patrol endlessly.
        If you happen to be spotted by a guard, they will chase you for awhile. If you happen to evade them
        long enough, they will get bored and return to their patrol route. But if you happen to get caught,
        it's off to jail for you.
        </p>
        <p><b>Don't get spotted by the security cameras!</b> Entering the security cameras line of sight 
        will alert every guard in the map to your position. They will leave their positions and 
        go to the place you were spotted.

        <p><b>There are a variety of tools at your disposal!</b> Tools are scattered about most levels and can help
        you get an edge up on the competition. Simply walk over a tool and press space to use it. You can cycle
        between tools by pressing q and e. Tools break after one use so use them wisely!

        <p>There are currently 10 levels in the game. Each level is more challenging than the last.
            You are given a score based on your speed, coins collected, and if you were seen by the guards.
